# >>> nlp = SpacyNlpMock()
# >>> doc = nlp(text)

# Get text and part of speech for each token in a doc.
# >>> [w.text for w in doc if w.pos in chosen_pos]

# Get the text of each sentence in a document.
# >>> [s.text for s in doc.sents]
#
# Rather than supply real answers, this mock does the following:
# - splits sentences by splitting on '. '
# - tokenizes into words by splitting on ' '
# - assigns parts of speech to always be NOUN
